Further to our meeting in Denver.... and as agreed, we are going to create a consolidated fundamentals package that will be maintained, controled and distributed by our group.  This package will form part of all of your outgoing conversations with customers and will be set up in such a way that it can be customized for each customer group, buyers or sellers. 

In short form, the information package will include:

*	Supply:		Complete historicals and forecasts for WCSB 
*	Demand:	historical demand broken down by tradeclass, region, 
*	Transportation:	historical loads, basis transport values, expansions etc
*	Generation:	gas fired new gen information that will affect future supply demand
* 	Storage:	AGA's historical - by region
* 	Hydro:		Historical flows / snow pack reports... items that will affect Hydro this year .. perhaps next
*	Misc:		Summary of misc and related items that will have an effect on West gas and power.. things that drive our business.'
*	Conclusions:	Summarize all of these variables.. update and make a determination on whether are not we are bullish - bearish-neutral.

I will track down an old copy of the files that we used ot use so as to not reinvent the wheel if and where at all possible.

WHO: Phillip will take the lead on putting this information package together. Dave Fuller will assist in some of the output. 

TIMELINE: 	This should be completed in draft form by the end of the week...


We should be after a guality package that we are prepared to take to our customers on a qrtly basis as part of our customer coverage rotation.

Call if any questions. Previous packages that you think are helpful shoudl be sent into phil's attention.
